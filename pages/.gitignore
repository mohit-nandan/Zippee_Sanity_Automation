# Allure Reports (HTML reports generated by Allure)
# The raw results are typically needed for generation, but not the heavy HTML output.
# If you are serving HTML reports directly from the raw results, then allure-results
# might be listed here instead of html-reports.
# However, you are using the 'reports/allure-results' for raw data and
# 'reports/html-reports' for generated HTML.
# So, we ignore the generated HTML reports, but keep the raw results for re-generation.
reports/html-reports/ # Ignore the timestamped HTML report folders

# If you decide to ignore the raw allure results as well (e.g., for very large test runs)
# then uncomment the line below. But usually you keep them to regenerate reports.
